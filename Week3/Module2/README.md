## Today We Learned About

### Control Flow

- Decisions
  - We make decisions based on conditions all the time. 
  - Say you're deciding what to do this weekend. If it doesn't rain, you'll go to the park. Otherwise, you might go see a movie.
  - Part of what makes programming interesting is that we can tell computers how to make decisions, too. A computer can ask itself: "If this is true, I'll do this. Else, I'll do this other thing. This is called control flow (that is, we're controlling the flow of the program).
- Booleans
  - First, we'll need some way to represent the difference between yes and no, or true and false. The way to do this in JavaScript is with the Boolean data type. _(Note: the word "Boolean" comes from the name of the mathematician George Boole)_.
  - The **Boolean data type** has two values: **`true` and `false`**. Just like numbers and strings, we can store these values in variables to give them more meaning.

### Boolean Logic 
How to evaluate more complex situations (more than one factors to consider)

different conditions:

- AND Logic
- OR Logic
- NOT Logic

### Functions 
Functions are re-usable blocks of code. Up until now, we haven't worries about re-using any of the code that we've written. However, as our programs get longer and longer, we'll often find ourselves wanting to perform the same task again and again.
