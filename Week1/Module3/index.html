        <p id="fun-fact">Completed on March 31, 1889, the tower was the world’s tallest man-made structure for 41 years
            until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>It is 324 metres tall (including antennas) and weighs 10,100 tonnes.</li>
            <li>It is possible to climb to the top, but there are 1,665 steps. Most people take the elevator.</li>
            <li> The elevators travel a combined distance of 103,000 km a year – two and a half times the circumference
                of the Earth.</li>
            <li>Victor Lustig, a con artist, "sold" the tower for scrap metal on two separate occasions.</li>
            <li>Gustave Eiffel, the engineer and architect behind the tower, was also involved in a disastrous attempt
                by the French to build a canal in Panama, and his reputation was badly damaged by the failure of the
                venture.</li>
